# AWS Recommended Backup Audit Framework Example

This example implements AWS's recommended backup framework configuration following best practices for enterprise backup strategies.

## AWS Backup Best Practices Implemented

1. **Minimum Retention Period**
   - 30-day minimum retention for all backups
   - Optional maximum retention period enforcement
   - Configurable vault locking for compliance

2. **Backup Frequency**
   - Daily backups as minimum requirement
   - Configurable frequency units and values
   - Continuous backup support for supported resources

3. **Resource Coverage**
   - EBS volumes for critical data
   - RDS databases and Aurora clusters
   - DynamoDB tables
   - EFS file systems
   - S3 buckets
   - EC2 instances
   - Comprehensive resource type protection

4. **Security**
   - Mandatory KMS encryption for all backups
   - Vault locking capabilities
   - Organization-wide policy enforcement
   - Cross-account backup support

5. **Disaster Recovery**
   - Cross-region backup copies
   - Multiple region support
   - Geographic redundancy

6. **Compliance and Reporting**
   - Comprehensive audit reports
   - Multiple output formats (CSV, JSON)
   - Cross-account visibility
   - Compliance status tracking

## Usage

1. Configure your AWS credentials and region
2. Customize the configuration in `terraform.tfvars`:

```hcl
audit_config = {
  vault = {
    kms_key_arn = "your-kms-key-arn"
  }
  reporting = {
    bucket_name = "your-audit-report-bucket"
  }
}
```

3. Initialize and apply:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Required Inputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `audit_config.vault.kms_key_arn` | KMS key ARN for backup encryption |
| `audit_config.reporting.bucket_name` | S3 bucket for audit reports |

## AWS Compliance Standards

This configuration helps meet various AWS compliance standards:

- ☑️ HIPAA backup requirements
- ☑️ SOC 2 data protection controls
- ☑️ PCI DSS backup requirements
- ☑️ GDPR data protection requirements

## Important Notes

1. **Cost Considerations**
   - Cross-region backup copies incur additional costs
   - S3 storage costs for reports
   - Consider retention periods impact on storage costs

2. **Prerequisites**
   - AWS Organizations setup for organization-wide deployment
   - KMS key with appropriate permissions
   - S3 bucket for reports
   - IAM permissions for cross-account operations

3. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
   - Regular review of audit reports
   - Periodic testing of backup restores
   - Compliance status monitoring
   - Cost monitoring and optimization
